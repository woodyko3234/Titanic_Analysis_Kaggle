##Data Dictionary

Variable	     Definition	              Key

###Variable Notes

pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancÃ©s were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.                                        
```{r}
# Check the formats of each variable
head(titan_train)
str(titan_train)
```

```{r}
# Turn some critical int into factor
titan_train$Survived <- factor(titan_train$Survived)
titan_train$Pclass <- factor(titan_train$Pclass)
```

```{r}
# Show simple distribution
summary(titan_train)
```

Note: Age info of 177 ppl in training dataset are unknown, which means we can 
      not apply it into our analysis. 
      Also, 2 ppl are without embarked location and 687 ppl are without cabin information.
```{r}
# Replace NA values
for (i in range(1, 891)){
  if (is.na(titan_train$Age[i])){
    titan_train$Age[i] = NULL
  }
  if (is.na(titan_train$Embarked[i])){
    titan_train$Embarked[i] = NULL
  }
}
```

## Univariate plotting

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = SibSp), data = titan_train) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(aes(y = (..count..), 
                label = ..count..), 
            stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5, check_overlap = T, 
            size = 3, position = position_dodge(width = 0))
```

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = Parch), data = titan_train) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(aes(y = (..count..), 
                label = ..count..), 
            stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5, check_overlap = T, 
            size = 3, position = position_dodge(width = 0))
```

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = Pclass), data = titan_train) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(aes(y = (..count..), 
                label = ..count..), 
            stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5, check_overlap = T, 
            size = 3, position = position_dodge(width = 0))
```

```{r}
table(titan_train$Ticket)
```

```{r}
# Does ticket type have any impact on suvival?
# https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/Statistics/M.1277714037.A.2CC.html
titan_train$ticket.type <- factor(substr(titan_train$Ticket, start = 1, stop = 1))

ggplot(aes(x = ticket.type, fill = Survived), data = titan_train) +
  geom_bar(position=position_dodge()) +
  geom_text(aes(y = (..count..), 
                label = ..count..), 
            stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5, check_overlap = T, 
            size = 3, position = position_dodge(width = 0.5))
```
Ticket type 1, 2, P have higher suvival rate than others

```{r}
# Does ticket fare have any impact on suvival?
# Cut the fare range

titan_train$fare.range <- cut(titan_train$Fare, 
                              c(-0.01, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, 
                                max(titan_train$Fare)+1))

ggplot(aes(fare.range, fill = Survived), data = titan_train)+
  geom_bar(position=position_dodge()) +
  geom_text(aes(y = (..count..), 
                label = ..count..), 
            stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5, check_overlap = T, 
            size = 3, position = position_dodge(width = 1))
```

Ticket fare higher than 50 got higher chance to survive

```{r}
# Other analysis on survival (Sex)
ggplot(aes(x = Sex, fill = Survived), data = titan_train) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ((..count..)/sum(..count..))), position = 'dodge') +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  geom_text(aes(y = ((..count..)/sum(..count..)), 
                label = scales::percent((..count..)/sum(..count..))), 
            stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0, check_overlap = T, 
            size = 3, position = position_dodge(width = 0.7)) +
  ylab('Percentage') 

```
Females have much high chance to survive

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = Pclass, fill = Survived), data = titan_train) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ((..count..)/sum(..count..))), position = 'dodge') +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  geom_text(aes(y = ((..count..)/sum(..count..)), 
                label = scales::percent((..count..)/sum(..count..))), 
            stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0, check_overlap = T, 
            size = 3, position = position_dodge(width = 0.7)) +
  ylab('Percentage') 
```

Class 1 has pretty high chance to survive, 2 has about 50-50.

```{r}
# correlation with family and age
# chidren & women first?
ggplot(aes(x = Sex, fill = Survived), 
       data = subset(titan_train, Parch >= 1 & Age <= 25)) +
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge') +
  facet_wrap(~ Pclass) +
  geom_text(aes(y = (..count..), 
                label = ..count..), 
            stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5, check_overlap = T, 
            size = 3, position = position_dodge(width = 1))
```

Every woman with age below 25, boarding with family with ticket class 2 survived. Awesome!

```{r}
# Does embarking location matter?

ggplot(aes(x = Embarked, fill = Survived), data = titan_train) +
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge') + 
  facet_wrap(~ Pclass) +
  geom_text(aes(y = (..count..), 
                label = ..count..), 
            stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5, check_overlap = T, 
            size = 3, position = position_dodge(width = 1))
